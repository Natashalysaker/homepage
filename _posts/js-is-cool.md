## The start of my journey


Hello and welcome. My name is Natasha Lysaker. I am a frontend develuper based in Norway, 
i am currentely studing frontend-development at Noroff - School of Technology and Digital Media, in Oslo.

As a part of my journey in tech and design I have started this website. Here I will eventually share my projects, write about what I learn and what I am interested in. Hope to see you around
